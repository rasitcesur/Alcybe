## About Alcybe

Alcybe is a computing and a simulation platform, which consist of various structures to solve real-world problems. Alcybe takes its name from the fact that it provides the modeling of the real world events exactly. Thus, the name Alcybe is "Alternate Cyberverse", which means the digital duplicate of the real-world. For simulating a real event, a hybrid simulation engine is developed, which enables both continuous and discrete events can be called synchronously. This engine is capable of being operated with real-time data to simulate a real event concurrently.
